Airgead Banking App

This project was the one that I chose to upload. Its complete; it met all project requirements; it compiles; it takes in user input and QC's it; it displays it correctly.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This particular project wasn't solving any sort of problem. We were given a list of requirements that the program should do and were told to make it happen. Which I did. I went from a blank page of code to something that not only QC'd input from the user, but then displayed it correctly too.

What did you do particularly well?
1.I felt like I tried to document what the code was trying to do pretty well. The math equaision for compounding interest was extremely hard to textually discribe but I felt like it did a good job describing it. I even described how I figured out some problems that I was having. 
2. Main() part of the function was 3 lines long. 3 lines... 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To improve the coding experience, I would have typed comments as I went, describing what I wanted the code to do, and then wrote the code.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
1. Doing a step by step process of the compounding interest was rough, but I slogged thru it and described what I was doing along the way.
2. I needed to figure out how to clear user input if it was bad, which I did with the help of YouTube.
3. Doing int to double conversion was a pain. I had to walk thru each bit of the InterestCalculations() function to see where I was going wrong.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
1. Troubleshooting. This is an invaluable skill to have with coding.
2. Patience with your code. After you type-vomit your code into Eclipse, or what ever developing software you're using, its not going to work. It wont display right. It might not display anything at all (JVM & JNI project that I worked on later on in the school term). But organizing your type-vomitted text and hitting the run button a ton of times, taking breaks... eventually paid off...

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My comments really helped in this department, infact I doublt that the end user would know what was going on without the comments. having imbedded for loops made things extremely confusing, but I Feel like the comments clarified things.
